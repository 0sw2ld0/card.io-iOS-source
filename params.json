If you see something that could benefit from being tidied up, rewritten, or otherwise improved, your Pull Requests will be welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\r\n\r\nBrought to you by  \r\n[![PayPal logo](https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/tree/master/Resources/pp_h_rgb.png)](https://paypal.com/ \"PayPal\")\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing **card.io**\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nIf you merely wish to incorporate **card.io** within your iOS app, simply download the latest official release from https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK. That repository includes complete integration instructions and sample code.\r\n\r\n\r\nDev setup\r\n---------\r\n\r\n* clone this repo, including its `dmz` submodule: `git submodule sync; git submodule update --init --recursive`\r\n* requires Xcode 5+ (toolchain for iOS 7)\r\n* requires Python 2.6+\r\n* for building releases, requires [`pip`](http://www.pip-installer.org/) and [`fabric`](http://www.fabfile.org)\r\n\r\n### Python\r\n\r\nWe use python-based build scripts.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    # If you are using virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper, create a virtualenv\r\n    # (optional but recommended)\r\n    mkvirtualenv cardio\r\n\r\n    # Install dependencies\r\n    pip install -r pip_requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Baler\r\n\r\nWe use [baler](https://github.com/paypal/baler) (included in `pip_requirements.txt`) to encode assets (strings and images) within our library. Create a `.baler_env` file in the top project directory, and set the `$PATH` environment variable to include where you installed baler. Examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    # Create a .baler_env, specifying the correct path for an installation using virtualenv\r\n    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.virtualenvs/cardio/bin' > .baler_env\r\n    \r\n    # - OR -\r\n\r\n    # Create a .baler_env, specifying the correct path if not using virtualenv\r\n    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'`dirname \\`which bale\\`` > .baler_env\r\n```\r\n\r\n### card.io-dmz\r\n\r\nThe [card.io-dmz](https://github.com/card-io/card.io-dmz) submodule (included here in the `dmz` directory) includes the core image-processing code.\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal development\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nUse Xcode in a normal fashion to build the library. The project's `icc` target is a demo app which will allow you to exercise the library in various ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnofficial card.io-iOS-SDK release\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nHow to make a Release build of the library for your own use:\r\n\r\n* Run `fab build:outdir=~` (or specify some other output directory).\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial card.io-iOS-SDK release\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n[How official releasers officially make an official release of card.io-iOS-SDK](official_release.md)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n\r\n**card.io** was created by [Josh Bleecher Snyder](https://github.com/josharian/).\r\n\r\nSubsequent help has come from [Brent Fitzgerald](https://github.com/burnto/), [Tom Whipple](https://github.com/tomwhipple), [Dave Goldman](https://github.com/dgoldman-ebay), and [Roman Punskyy](https://github.com/romk1n).\r\n\r\nAnd from **you**!
